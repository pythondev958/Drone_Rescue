# 🛰️ DroneRescue: AI-Powered Flood Relief Simulation with YOLOv8

**DroneRescue** is a simulation project that showcases how drones equipped with computer vision can detect people stranded in floodwaters and virtually drop lifejackets. Built using Ultralytics YOLOv8 and OpenCV, this simulation is hardware-free and ideal for rapid prototyping, demos, and awareness projects.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time detection of people using YOLOv8
- 🚁 Simulated drone visuals (top-down perspective)
- 🦺 Animated lifejacket "drop" toward detected people
- 🎥 Automatically saves annotated output video
- 🧪 Pure Python — no physical drone or hardware required

## 📦 Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the project

python flood_simulation.py
